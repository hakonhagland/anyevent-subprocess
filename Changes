            - allow Job delegate to receive child return value and exception
            - don't "exit 0" in the child handler
            - remove our own exception-printing code
            - add PrintError delegate (use this instead)
            - fix cloning of Job delegates (they are cloned correctly now)
            - make classes immutable
            - doc fixes (but not everything)
            - dependency fixes

            - delegates get the instance they are attached to
            - run can be called multiple times
            - lots more docs and examples (still needs more!)

            - developer preview
            * needs a lot more docs
            * a few design decisions still in question
             - should delegates get the instance they are attached to?
